## **What This Is About**

This method makes hiring decisions based on data and evidence, not gut feelings. It combines AI tools with human judgment to reduce bias and hire better candidates.

**How it works:**
- **AI handles:** Repetitive tasks, processing large volumes of data, spotting patterns and potential biases
- **Humans handle:** Context, judgment calls, talking to candidates, final decisions

**Three goals:**
1. **Less bias** – Decisions based on facts, not feelings
2. **Save time** – Automate boring tasks, focus on important ones
3. **Better candidate experience** – Clear, fast, transparent process

## **The 8 Steps**

### **Step 1: Smart CV Reading (AI)**

The AI reads CVs intelligently, not just looking for keywords.

**Example:** If someone wrote "built recommendation system for 10M users," the AI understands this means they know machine learning, large-scale systems, and production deployment—even if they didn't write those exact words.

**Output:** Ranked list of candidates with scores (0-100) across 5 areas: technical skills, impact, behavior, learning ability, and culture fit.

---

### **Step 2: First Contact (AI)**

Top candidates (top 20-30%) get personalized messages that reference their specific work.

**Not:** "We found your profile interesting"  
**Instead:** "Your work on [specific project] is exactly what we need for [concrete reason]"

---

### **Step 3: Basic Screening (AI)**

AI chatbot asks simple qualifying questions: salary expectations, availability, must-have requirements. Filters out mismatches automatically.

---

### **Step 4: First Bias Check (Human + AI)**

**This is crucial.** Recruiter reviews who should move forward. AI challenges weak reasoning.

**Example conversation:**
- **Recruiter:** "I'm rejecting this candidate, just don't feel right about them"
- **AI:** "This candidate scored 89/100 and ranks 3rd overall. 'Gut feeling' often means unconscious bias. What objective reason supports rejection?"

**Result:** Every decision must have evidence behind it.

---

### **Step 5: Skills Test (AI + Human)**

Candidates complete a written assessment (45-60 minutes) testing real skills, not interview performance.

**Why written?** Removes bias from communication style, accents, nervousness.

**Content:**
- 30% behavioral questions (how you solve problems, learn, collaborate)
- 70% technical questions (actual job skills)

AI scores responses based on depth, specificity, and quality—not buzzwords.

---

### **Step 6: Interview Setup (AI + Human)**

AI handles scheduling (calendars, time zones, reminders).

Interviewers get full reports from previous steps, so they can have deeper conversations instead of asking basic screening questions again.

---

### **Step 7: Interview Feedback (AI)**

Right after interviews, AI sends structured feedback forms to all interviewers and compiles their input into one clear report.

---

### **Step 8: Final Bias Check (Human + AI)**

Team reviews all finalists. AI challenges subjective reasoning one last time.

**Example:**
- **Team:** "I prefer Candidate A's vibe"
- **AI:** "'Vibe' isn't measurable. Candidate B scored 15 points higher and got unanimous positive feedback. What concrete factors support choosing Candidate A?"

**Result:** Final decision matches the evidence.

| Step | What Happens | Why It Matters |
|------|--------------|----------------|
| **1** | AI reads CVs intelligently | Find qualified people, including non-traditional profiles |
| **2** | AI sends personalized messages | Get responses from top candidates |
| **3** | AI asks qualifying questions | Filter out basic mismatches |

## **The Big Picture**

This method creates a system where:
- Every decision has evidence behind it
- Bias gets challenged at key moments
- Humans focus on judgment, not admin work
- Candidates get evaluated on skills, not presentation

It's recruitment treated as science, not guesswork.
